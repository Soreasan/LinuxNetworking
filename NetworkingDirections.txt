On the Linux Server machine in the commandline type "ifconfig" to get the ip address.
Under the information provided look for "Ethernet HWaddr" and then near that should be
a section that says "inet addr" with a number like 192.168.44.222.  
On the client in the commandline type "ssh username@192.168.44.222" to connect.
For example if my username is "kenneth" then I would type "ssh kenneth@192.168.44.222" 
to connect.  After we connect via ssh it will ask for the password.  After you type that
in you'll be connected and you can use lsof and nmap and other stuff freely. 

The program that allows the Linux machine to receive connections is called "openssh-server".
If we have errors with the ssh I assume that's what we'll be googling.  
Some common commands for openssh-server are:
sudo restart ssh
sudo systemctl restart ssh

The website I referenced for openssh-server is:
